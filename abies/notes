# Summary

1. Dispersal kernel: Cauchy, with sd 50m to 100m

2. Generation time: 50 years.

3. Spatial locations: in coordsXY.csv

4. Prior to 20Kya, keep the population configuration constant.


# Future additions

## Barriers:

> alternatively, and maybe better: if you worked out a DEM-based multiplier for each pair of adjacent populations, I could just multiply the migration matrices by this.  (e.g., you give me B_{ij}, where if cells i and j are separated by mountains, then B_{ij} = 0; and if the cells have no barrier between them, B_{ij} = 1; then I compute M_{ij} in flat space and use M_{ij} * B_{ij} as the migration matrix)

well, we have been thinking along the same lines with Eniko... I suppose that the alternative solution is better. However, I suggest to ignore this for now, and we can add this layer of DEM multipliers later.


## Dispersal kernel

> Cauchy... we need still an estimate of "typical distance" and something like "with 1/1000 pollination events happening across a scale of 5km".

this sounds perfect.
 

# Notes


> computing total number of trees per grid cell as
>  (1-lu.area[,,t])*area*fpc.grid[,,10,t]/40

this isn't correct. it should be lu.area[,,t] and not 1-lu.area[,,t]

taking this into account, the total number of individuals doubles from time 1 to 2204, we go from 5 billion to 10 billion. Some notes:
* area is the grid area taking into account the projection (small grid towards the north)
* lu.area is the proportion of the area where forests and grasslands are possible (excludes coastlines, lakes)
* 40 is the m2 as area needed for an adult reproducing tree (guess)
* fpc: occurrence probability for each species calculated by the climate model (Abies alba is species 10)

DGVM_data/Rfornetcdf.r has my script with comments, which should be useful

> what is a reaonsable guess at mean generation time? (this is: for an average individual, how old was their parent when they were born)

25 years has been used before for related species, but 50 might be closer to reality because Abies alba is a shade-liking non-pioneer species.

Another comment on the migration rates, it is often cited that effective pollen dispersal can be up to 100km. However, I wouldn't use this figure because trees cannot establish new populations with pollen, but only with grains. Fine scale population structureÂ  analysis generally reveals that kinship decays within 50 to 100m, which should reflect the effective migration rate for seeds. With this figure, it might be difficult to colonize from S France to N Germany, so I don't know if there was a way of including occasional bigger jumps (seeds have wings, so they can occasionally get further away, 5-10km eg).


---------------

We have ~350 SNPs for 1100 individuals from 53 populations across Europe and we
would like to simulate SNP data to assess if the observed genetic diversity
levels can be explained by population size/isolation or demographic history
(such as founder effect).

We also have independent data on the demographic history from a climate/pollen
modelling study, more specifically, we have the estimated population size at
each grid in every 10 years for the last 22000 years. The total number of
individuals on the whole grid is between 2-5 billion, and our grid is of 55x70
(with many empty spots).
Overall, it's a recolonization history with a huge bottleneck ~15 000 years ago.
A thousand nonempty cells sounds about right. We have population density estimates for 2204 time points.

My original plan was to use this data set to test the central-marginal
hypothesis. Silver fir has a very fragmented distribution and an important
variation is population size.However, current population size didn't explain
the observed diversity patterns at all. In contrast, it seems extremely likely
that demographic history is the main factor that shapes diversity patterns. It
wouldn't be too surprising because Ne is so big that any changes in diversity
levels are extremely show. Now, we would like to show it with simulations of
increasing complexity.


have a grid of 55x70, for each grid we know the population sizes for 2204 time
points starting 20 000 years ago, ending today. (Do we need to calculate
migration rates from the population sizes or we can define the migration matrix
based on other things, such as wind directions, dispersal distances, or
geographical barriers?) We would like to sample in total 1100 individuals from
53 locations. Some of these locations fall on the same grid though. And the
final goal is to have a sequence of 350 independent loci for all these
individuals. And repeat this several times, that we can compare the diversity
to the real data we have and see whether the population history/migration
pattern explains what we observe. 

> Oh, and also: what should happen *before* 20 000 years ago?  Merge into a single population?

We suspect that all individuals can be traced back to an ancestral population that was situated somewhere on the southern part of the Apennines, so yes, merge to a single population would be realistic.


> the original netcdf is 2.3 GB (DGVM_data/abiesalba_h1x1.cdf), 

It contains the raw data from the climate modelling. It's mainly the variable
fpc in it that interests us because this is our indicator of population size
for each grid. Eniko's been working on translating fpc to population size and
she will send this to you.

So, actually you don't need to worry about this file much for now, however, if
you want to look to have a feel for the data: look
Dropbox/DGVM_data/read_netcdf.r and you will quickly understand what kind of
info we have from the climate modellers.
 

> 1. spatial configuration (size and locatoin) of the grid cells

Eniko will send this.
 
> 2. how big the ancestral population this should merge into at 20K years ago should be

this will be a wild guess for now, and then we can elaborate on it. 
@Eniko, can you tell the total population size at the first time slot?
@Peter, would it be possible to have a spatially non-explicit part for the pre-20K times and then distribute the trees on the grids?
 
> 3. what to use as the mean dispersal distance, and if a Gaussian kernel is most appropriate or if a different kernel is better

Gaussian will do the job. We know from fine-scale spatial genetic studies that relatedness decays within 50 to 100m, so this figure could be a starting point.

If you want to include geographic barriers to migration, I'd need you to work out where/when those would be.  Options include:

> 1. don't worry about barriers, treating all grid squares the same (this seems fine on the resolution we're working on?) 

sure this would be fine, but we have holes on the grid, mainly where there is the sea. This info can be included as barriers. 
@Eniko could you get this matrix of go vs no-go grids?
 
> 2. you give me a list of pairs of adjacent grid squares that should not have any migration between them

Then we could use the DEM to define further barriers (eg the Alps).
@Peter: could we also give a specific migration matrix where the migration is adjusted according to the length of the barrier that separates the two grids?

Apart from barriers, it's also quite obvious that it's easier to migrate W<->E than S<->N due to climate differences, maybe worth considering?

## About the density estimate

It is an estimate, calculated from the size of the grid, the proportion of the
grid that is not occupied by water, the coverage, and assuming that one tree
needs 40m^2. This number comes from the Ruousch paper's supplement, but if the
simulations are fast we could assume more sparse/dense structures.
